Mindfulness can reduce stress and help you to manage depression and anxiety. Try breathing exercises â€” they can reduce stress and improve symptoms of anxiety and depression. Talk to your family, friends and work colleagues â€” donâ€™t bottle up your emotions. If you have an issue with someone, try to deal with it straight away so youâ€™re not stewing over it and causing yourself unnecessary stress. Cry if you need to â€” some people find it can make them feel better. Donâ€™t feel embarrassed. Crying may ease pressure and tension. Eat a balanced diet â€” a poor diet can increase feelings of anxiety and depression. Get enough sleep â€” sleep is closely linked to your mental health."
